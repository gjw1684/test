# Preface to the Moral Law

Q. 83: What is the duty which God requires of man?

A: The duty which God requires of man is obedience to His plainly and fully revealed will which is our reasonable service due to Him as our Creator, preserver, Master, and Sovereign.

Q. 84: In the beginning what did God reveal unto man as the rule of His obedience?

A: The rule of obedience revealed to Adam in the state of innocence, and to all mankind in him (besides a special command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil) was the moral law.

Q. 85: What is the moral law?

A: The moral law is the declaration of the will of God for humanity, founded upon the perfections of God, which directs and binds everyone to personal, complete, exact, and perpetual conformity. The moral law applies to the whole man, body and soul, and includes the performances of all those duties of holiness and righteousness which he owes to God and man. God promised life for keeping it and threatened death for disobeying it.

Q. 86: Is there any use of the moral law to man since the Fall?

A: Although after the fall no one can attain to righteousness and life by means of the moral law, it is still of great use and still applies to all men, whether unregenerate or the regenerate.

Q. 87: Of what use is the moral law to all men?

A: The moral law is of use to all men because it informs them of the holy nature and will of God and because it informs them of their duty to live by it. It also reveals to them the sinful pollution of their nature, hearts, and lives, which convinces them that they are unable to keep it. The moral law also humbles men with the recognition of their sinfulness and misery and thereby gives them a better awareness of their need for Christ and for the perfection of His obedience.

Q. 88: Of what particular use is the moral law to unregenerate men?

A: The moral law is of particular use to unregenerate men because it awakens their consciences to flee from the coming wrath and so drive them to Christ. However, if they continue in their unregenerate and sinful condition, the moral law has left them without excuse and under its curse.

Q. 89: Of what particular use is the moral law to regenerate men?

A: Although those who are regenerate are freed from the moral law as a covenant of works, so that they are neither justified nor condemned by it, the moral law is of particular use to believers because it shows them how much they owe to Christ for fulfilling it and for enduring its curse in their place and for their good. This recognition provokes believers to greater thankfulness, so that they would take greater care to conform themselves to the moral law as the rule of their obedience.

Q. 90: Where is the moral law summarized?

A: The moral law is summarized in the Ten Commandments, which were delivered by the voice of God on Mount Sinai and written down by Him on two stone tablets. The first four commandments establish our obligations to God and the remaining six our obligations to human beings.

Q. 91: What is the sum of the Ten Commandments?

A: The sum of the four commandments containing our duty to God is, to love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our strength, and with all our mind. The sum of the six commandments which contain our duty to man is, to love our neighbor as ourselves, and to do to others what we would have them to do to us.

Q. 92: What is the preface to the Ten Commandments?

A: The preface to the Ten Commandments is:_I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the land of slavery._In these words God reveals His sovereign being as LORD, in and of Himself, eternal, unchangeable, and almighty God, who gives being to all His words and works. God also points here to His covenantal relationship with the Israelites in ancient times and with all His people, so that just as He brought the Israelites out of their slavery in Egypt, He delivers us from spiritual enslavement. Consequently, we are bound to accept only Him as our God and to keep all His commandments.

Q. 93: What are the guidelines for the proper understanding of the Ten Commandments?

A: In order to understand the ten commands properly, these guidelines should be followed:

The law is perfect and binds the whole person to observe it completely, and according to its standard, to be completely righteous, and perfectly obey every one of its obligations forever. Moreover, the law forbids even the slightest or partial commission of any sin.
Since it is spiritual, the law involves our understanding, our will, our emotions, and all the other faculties of the soul, as well as our words, actions, and self-expressions.
Different aspects of one and the same thing may be required or forbidden in several different commandments.
Where a duty is commanded, the opposite is forbidden; and, where a specific sin is forbidden, its opposite is commanded. In the same way, when a requirement of the law adds a promise of blessing for obedience, that promise also includes a warning for disobedience. When a warning is added, an opposite promises is included.
What God forbids must never be done at any time or under any circumstances. What he commands always remains an obligation, although every particular obligation of the law does not apply in all circumstances or at all times.
The prohibitions against specific sins and the commandments to observe specific obligations are typical and so cover not just those particular sins or obligations but all others of the same kind. They similarly include all the contributory causes, means, opportunities, and appearances related to these sins and obligations.
Since the provisions of the law apply not only to us but to everyone else, we must try to help others keep those provisions, in the context of our position in life and theirs.
Similarly, we must support others in keeping what the law commands them to do or not to do and particularly by not joining them in doing what is forbidden to them.
