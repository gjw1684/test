# The Person and Work of Christ

Q. 35: Who is the Redeemer of God’s elect?

A: The only Redeemer of God’s elect (and the only Mediator of the Covenant of Grace) is the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the eternal Son of God, of one substance and equal with the Father.

Q. 36: How did Christ, being the Son of God, become man?

Q. 37: Why was it necessary that the Mediator should be God?

A: It was necessary that the Mediator should be God so that He might sustain and keep His human nature from collapsing under the infinite wrath of God and the power of death; give worth and efficacy to His sufferings, obedience, and intercession; and to satisfy God’s justice, procure God’s favor, purchase His very own people, give His Spirit to them, conquer all their enemies, and bring them to everlasting salvation.

Q. 38: Why was it necessary that the Mediator should be man?

A: It was necessary that the Mediator should be man so that He might improve human nature,perform obedience to the Law, suffer and make intercession for us in our nature, have a fellow feeling of our infirmities; and so that we might receive the adoption of sons, and have comfort and access with boldness unto the throne of grace.

Q. 39: Why was it necessary that the Mediator should be God and man in one person?

A: It was necessary that the Mediator, who was to reconcile God and man, should Himself be both God and man in one person, so that the proper works of each nature might be accepted of God on our behalf, and relied on by us as the works of the whole person.

Q. 40: Why was our Redeemer called Jesus Christ?

Q. 45: How does Christ execute the office of a king?

Q. 47: How did Christ humble Himself in His conception and birth?

Finally, enduring the painful, shameful, and cursed death on the cross, He laid down His life as an offering for sin.

Q. 50: How did Christ humble Himself after His death?

By His resurrection, He plainly declared Himself to be the Son of God, to have satisfied divine justice, to have conquered death as well as Him who holds the power of death, and to be Lord of the living and the dead. He did all this as a public person and as the head of His church in order to justify believers, make them alive in His grace, support them against their enemies, and to assure them of their resurrection from the dead at the last day.

Q. 53: How was Christ exalted in His ascension?

A: Christ was exalted in His ascension, in that, having after His resurrection appeared numerous times and conversed with His apostles, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, and commissioning them to preach the gospel to all nations, He, in our nature and as our head, visibly ascended to the highest heavens forty days after His resurrection, triumphing over enemies. There, He receives gifts for men, raises our minds and affections, and prepares a place for us, where He is and shall continue to be until His second coming at the end of the world.

Q. 54: How is Christ exalted in His sitting at the right hand of the Father?

A: Christ is exalted in His sitting at the right hand of Father, in that, as the God-man, He is advanced to the highest favor with God the Father with all fullness of joy, glory, and power over all things in heaven and earth. There, Christ gathers and defends His church, subdues their enemies; provides His ministers and people with gifts and graces, and makes intercession for them.

Q. 55: How is Christ to be exalted in His imminent return to judge the world?

A: Christ is to be exalted in His imminent return to judge the world, in that He, who was unjustly judged and condemned by wicked men, shall come again at the last day in great power and in the full manifestation of His own and His Father’s glory with all His holy angels, accompanied by a shout of command, the voice of the archangel and the trumpet of God, to judge the world in righteousness.
