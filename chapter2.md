# Attributes of God

Q. 9: What is God?

A: God is a Spirit, who in and of himself is infinite in being, glory, blessedness, and perfection. God is all-sufficient, eternal, unchangeable, incomprehensible, omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, most wise, most holy and just, most merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant with goodness and truth.

Q. 10: Is there more than one God?

A: There is but one only: the living and true God. Yet, there are three persons in the Godhead: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three are one true, eternal God, the same in substance, equal in power and glory; although distinguished by their personal properties.

Q. 11: What are the personal properties of the three persons of the Godhead?

A: From all eternity, it is proper to the Father to beget the Son, and to the Son to be begotten of the Father, and to the Holy Spirit to proceed from the Father and the Son.

Q. 12: How may we know that the Son and the Holy Spirit are God, equal with the Father?

A: The Scriptures manifest that the Son and the Holy Spirit are equal with the Father, ascribing unto them such names, attributes, works, and worship as are proper to God only.

Q. 13: What are the decrees of God?

A: Godâ€™s decrees are the wise, free, and holy acts from the purposes of His will, whereby, from all eternity, He has, in Himself and for His own glory, unchangeably foreordained whatsoever comes to pass in time, particularly concerning angels and men.

Q. 14: What has God particularly decreed concerning angels and men?

A: By an eternal and immutable decree, which originates solely from His love and exists for the praise of His glorious grace to be manifested in due time, God has elected some angels to glory; and in Christ has chosen some men for eternal life, along with the means thereof. Additionally, in accordance with His sovereign power and the unsearchable purposes of His will (by which He extends or withholds favor as He pleases), God passed by and foreordained the rest to be inflicted with dishonor and wrath for their sin, to the praise of His glorious justice.

Q. 15: How does God execute His decrees?

A: God executes His decrees in the works of creation and providence, according to His infallible foreknowledge and the free and immutable counsel of His own will.
