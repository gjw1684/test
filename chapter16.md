# Prayer

Q. 175: What is prayer?

A: Prayer is offering our desires to God in the name of Christ with the help of His Spirit, confessing our sins, and thankfully recognizing His mercies.

Q. 176: Should we pray only to God?

A: God is the only one capable of searching human hearts, the only one who hears requests, pardons sins, and fulfills the desires of everyone, and He is the only one to believe in and truly worshiped. Since prayer is an integral part of religious worship, it is to be made by everyone only to Him and to no one else.

Q. 177: What is the significance of praying in Christ’s name?

A: When we pray in Christ’s name, we obey His command and confidently rely on His promises as a basis for requesting mercy for His sake. This involves not just mentioning His name but drawing our encouragement to pray and our boldness, strength, and hope that our prayers will be answered from Christ Himself and His mediation.

Q. 178: Why must we pray in Christ’s name?

A: Human sinfulness has so far separated us from God that we cannot gain access to His presence without a mediator to bridge that separation, and since no one in heaven or earth has been appointed to or is fit for that glorious job except Christ alone, we must pray in His name only and in no other.

Q. 179: How does the Spirit help us to pray?

A: Since we do not know what we ought to pray for, the Spirit helps our weakness by enabling us to understand for whom, for what, and how to pray. He works in and makes our hearts alive (although not in everyone, nor all the time, nor to the same degree) to grasp, feel, and experience the gifts that are needed to pray properly.

Q. 180: For whom should we pray?

A: We should pray for the entire church of Christ on earth, for civil authorities and ministers, for ourselves and fellow believers, and for our enemies. We should pray for all people who are alive, and those who are going to live in the future. But we should not pray for the dead or for those who are known to have sinned the sin that leads to death.

Q. 181: For what should we pray?

A. We should pray for things that promote the glory of God, the welfare of the church, and our own or others’ good, but not for anything that is unlawful.

Q. 182: How should we pray?

A: In prayer, we should approach God with a reverent awareness of His majesty and a deep sense of our unworthiness, inadequacies, and sins. Our hearts should be filled with repentance, thanks, and confidence, and our prayers should be marked by understanding, faith, sincerity, fervor, love, and perseverance, while we wait on Him and humbly submit to His will.

Q. 183: What rule has God given for our direction in prayer?

A: The whole Word of God is of use to direct us in prayer, but the special rule of direction is that prayer, which Christ taught His disciples, commonly called the Lord’s Prayer. The Lord’s Prayer not only direct us as a model for our other prayers but may also be used as a prayer itself that will promote our understanding, faith, reverence, and the other gifts of God in us that are necessary for us to pray properly.

Q. 184: What does the preface of the Lord’s Prayer teach us?

A: The preface of the Lord’s prayer,Our Father in heaven, teaches us that when we pray we should draw near to God, confident of His fatherly goodness and the benefits to us from that goodness, reverently and in every way like a child, and with heavenly feelings and a proper awareness of His sovereign power, His majesty, and His graciousness in allowing us to approach Him. The preface also teaches us to pray with and for others.

Q. 185: What do we pray for in the first petition?

A: In the first petition,hallowed be Your name, we acknowledge that we and all human beings are completely incapable of honoring God properly and are even disinclined to do so. We pray then that He would by His grace enable and incline us and others to know, to acknowledge, and to esteem Him highly, His titles, attributes, regulations, word, works, and everything else by which He is pleased to reveal Himself, and to glorify Him in thought, word, and deed, to the effect that he would thwart and do away with atheism, spiritual ignorance, idolatry, or any kind of desecration, and whatever else dishonors Him, and that by His invincible providence, He would direct and regulate everything to His own glory.

Q. 186: What do we pray for in the second petition?

A: In the second petition,_Your kingdom come,_we acknowledge that we and all humans are by nature under the dominion of sin and Satan. We pray then that the kingdom of sin and Satan be destroyed, that the gospel be preached throughout the whole world, that the Jews be converted, and that the full number of the Gentiles comes in. We pray that the church would be supplied with evangelical officers and regulations, purged from corruption, and recognized and supported by the civil authorities. We pray for the regulations of Christ to be administered fully and that these regulations may effectively convert sinners, while confirming, comforting, and building up those who are already converted. And we pray that Christ would rule over our hearts in the here and now, that he would hurry up and come again, when we shall reign with him forever, and that he would be pleased so to rule over everything that goes on in the world as may best bring about all these results.

Q. 187: For what do we pray in the third petiton?

A: In the third petition,_Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven_we acknowledge that we and all humans are by nature not only completely incapable of and unwilling to know and to do the will of God but are actively prone to rebel against His Word, to be unhappy with and complain about his providence, and are naturally inclined to follow our own selfish desires and the directions of Satan. We pray then that God would by his Spirit remove from us and others all spiritual blindness, weakness, indisposition to spiritual activities, and perverseness of heart, and that he would by his grace make us willing to know, do, and submit to his will in every circumstance, with the same kind of humility, cheerfulness, faithfulness, steadfastness, zeal, sincerity, and constancy that the angels have in heaven.

Q. 188: For what do we pray in the fourth petition?

A: In the fourth petition,_Give us today our daily bread,_we acknowledge that in Adam and by our own sin we have forfeited any right to all of the outward blessings of this life, that we deserve to be completely deprived of them by God and to have their use by us cursed, and that the outward blessings of this life are not in and of themselves capable of sustaining us, nor do we deserve or actually obtain them by our own efforts, but lust after, acquire, and use them in unlawful ways. We pray then for ourselves and others that both they and we may wait daily on God’s providential allowance of the outward blessings of this life and that, according to what his fatherly wisdom decides is best, we may lawfully enjoy his free gift of what is sufficient for us.We also pray that God would continue to bless us with sufficient worldly goods, that they would sustain our needs and be sanctified by us, that we would be satisfied with them, and that God would protect us from anything that undermines our support and sustenance in this world.

Q. 189: For what do we pray in the fifth petition?

A: In the fifth petition,_Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors,_we acknowledge that we and everyone else are guilty both of original sin and actual sins and are therefore debtors to God’s justice, and that neither we nor any other created being can make the least satisfaction for that debt. We pray then for ourselves and others that of his free grace and through the obedience and satisfaction of Christ, which is grasped and applied by faith, God would acquit us from the guilt and punishment of sin, accept us in the One he loves, continue his favor and grace to us, forgive our daily sins, and fill us with the peace and joy that come from the daily gift of growing assurance of being forgiven. We may more boldly make this request and be encouraged to expect to be forgiven, when and if we are assured in ourselves that we have genuinely, from the heart, forgiven others who have wronged us.

Q. 190: For what do we pray in the sixth petition?

A: In the sixth petition,_And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one,_we acknowledge that God, who is completely wise, righteous, and gracious, may, for various holy and just purposes, ordain circumstances by which we become the target of temptations, are defeated, and temporarily taken captive by them; that Satan, the world, and our own sinful natures have a powerful potential to turn us aside from righteousness and trap us; and that even after our sins have been forgiven, we are naturally so depraved, spiritually weak, and inattentive to our spiritual condition that we are not only prey to temptations and willingly expose ourselves to them but are completely incapable of and unwilling to resist, get away from, or use them as opportunities for our spiritual growth—and consequently we deserve to be left under their power. We pray then that God would so rule over the world and everyone in it, so curb our sinful natures and restrain Satan, so ordain all things, so endow and bless all the means of grace and sharpen our awareness in the use of them, that we and all his people may be providentially spared from being tempted to sin; or, if tempted, that his Spirit would powerfully support and enable us to resist during the time of our temptation; or, should we fall, that we would be raised again and restored, with the experience being thereby sanctified and used for our spiritual growth; and that our sanctification and salvation may be made complete, Satan trampled under our feet, and we become completely delivered from sin, temptation, and all evil, forever.

Q. 191: What does the conclusion of the Lord’s prayer teach us?

A: The conclusion of the Lord’s prayer,_for Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever,_teaches us that there must be substance to our requests, that they are based not on anyintrinsic worth in ourselves or any created being but on God himself, and that to our prayersshould be added praise, which recognizes God alone as eternally sovereign, omnipotent, and gloriously excellent. In that respect, insofar as he is able and willing to help us, our faith makesus bold to plead with him that he will help us and calmly to count on him to answer our prayers.To show that we want to be heard and have confidence that we are heard, we say Amen.
