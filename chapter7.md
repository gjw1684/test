# Salvation: The Application of Redemption

Q. 56: What benefits has Christ procured by His mediation?

A: Christ, by His mediation, has procured redemption with all the other benefits of the covenant of grace.

Q. 57: Who are made partakers of redemption through Christ?

A: Redemption is certainly applied and effectually communicated to all those for whom Christ has purchased it through the Holy Spirit who, in the process of time, works faith in them to believe in Christ as presented in the gospel, and thereby unites them, spiritually and mystically yet truly and inseparably, to Christ as their head and husband. This union with Christ is done in their effectual calling.

Q. 58: What is effectual calling?

A: Effectual calling is the work of God’s almighty power and grace, whereby He (out of His free and special love to His elect and not from anything inherently in them) at the right time invites and draws them to Jesus Christ by His Word and Spirit. God savingly enlightens their minds in the knowledge of Christ, renews and transforms their wills, and makes them (even though they are dead in sin) willing and freely able to answer His call voluntarily and to gladly accept the grace offered and conveyed.

Q. 59: Are the elect only effectually called?

A: All the elect, and only they, are effectually called. Although others may be and often are externally called by the ministry of the Word, and although the Spirit may work in them in some of the same ways He works in the elect, from their own willful neglect of and contempt for the grace offered to them, they are justly allowed to remain in their unbelief and never truly come to Christ.

Q. 60: Can those who have never heard the gospel and so neither know Jesus Christ nor believe in Him be saved by living according to their own natural understanding?

A: Those who have never heard the gospel and do not know Jesus Christ nor believe in Him cannot be saved no matter how diligently they frame their lives according to their own natural understanding or the laws of that religion which they profess. Salvation comes from no other than Christ alone.

Q. 61: What benefits do the elect experience through Christ in this life?

A: The elect experience union and communion with Him in grace and glory and thus, partake of the power of His mediation in their justification, adoption, sanctification, and whatever else, in this life, manifests their union with Him.

Q. 62: What is justification?

A: Justification is the act of God’s free grace unto sinners, by which He pardons all their sins and accepts them as righteous in His sight; not because of anything worked in them or done by them but because God imputes to them Christ’s active obedience unto the whole law, and passive obedience in His death for their whole and sole righteousness which can only be appropriated by faith.

Q. 63: How is justification an act of God’s free grace?

A: By His obedience and death Christ made the proper, real, and full satisfaction to God’s justice on behalf of those who are justified. Yet, insofar as this satisfaction is accepted by God as a guarantee of performance, which He might have demanded from the justified, and since God Himself provided a guarantor in the person of His only Son, in justification God imputes righteousness to the justified and requires nothing from them in return except faith, which they also have as a gift from Him. Consequently, justification comes to the justified as an act of God’s free grace.

Q. 64: What is saving faith?

A: Saving faith is an act of the free grace of God wrought in the hearts of sinners by the Spirit and the Word of God. By this faith, sinners are convinced of their sinfulness and miserable condition and of their inability in themselves (and all other creatures) to recover out of their lost condition, and by this faith, they give full assent to the truth of the gospel promise. They receive and rest on Christ and His righteousness for pardon of sin, as held forth in the gospel, and for being accepted and accounted as righteous in the sight of God for salvation.

Q. 65: How does faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?

A: Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God only as an instrument by which the sinner receives Christ and applies Christ’s righteousness, not because of any other grace that accompanies faith or because of any good works that result from faith. Nor is it the case that the grace of faith or any action springing from it is imputed to the sinner for His justification.

Q. 66: What is adoption?

A: Adoption is an act of the free grace of God in and for His only Son Jesus Christ, by which all those who are justified are received into the number of His children, have His name put upon them, have the Spirit of His Son given to them, are under His fatherly care, are welcomed to all the liberties and privileges of the sons of God, and are made heirs of all the promises and fellow-heirs with Christ in glory.

Q. 67: What is sanctification?

A: Sanctification is a work of God’s free grace for those whom God has chosen to be holy before the foundation of the world and to whom, in the process of time, the powerful operation of the Spirit applies the death and resurrection of Christ. They are thus renewed in their whole man after the image of God, have the seeds of repentance unto life and all the other saving graces put into their hearts and these graces are so aroused, increased, and strengthened that they progressively put sin to death and rise unto newness of life.

Q. 68: What is repentance unto life?

A: Repentance unto life is an act of God’s free grace wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit and the Word of God. By it, sinners recognize not only the danger of their sins but also the filthiness and repulsiveness of their sins to God. Understanding that in Christ, God is merciful to those who repent, sinners suffer such deep sorrow for and hate their sins so much that they turn away from all of them and turn to God, purposing to walk continually with Him according to this new obedience in every way.

Q. 69: What is the difference between justification and sanctification?

A: Although sanctification is inseparably joined with justification, the two are distinctly different. In justification God imputes the righteousness of Christ to believers whereas in sanctification, His Spirit infuses believers with grace, and enables them to exercise this grace. In justification, sin is pardoned apart from the work of the believer; whereas in sanctification, sin is subdued by the Spirit-empowered effort of the believer. Justification perfectly and equally frees all believers from the wrath of God so that they never fall into condemnation; whereas sanctification is not completed in any believer in this life, but only grows towards perfection.

Q. 70: Why are believers not completely sanctified?

A: Believers are not completely sanctified because they retain some remnants of sin through their whole being and are continually plagued with desires of their old sinful nature that are contrary to the Spirit. Consequently believers are frequently defeated by temptations, commit many sins, and are hindered from performing their spiritual obligations, so that their best works in God’s eyes are imperfect and defiled.

Q. 71: What are the benefits which in this life do accompany or flow from justification, adoption, and sanctification?

A: The benefits which in this life do accompany or flow from justification, adoption, and sanctification are the first-fruits of communion with Christ mainly in the form of interest in the glory Christ fully possesses, and, as a down payment on this communion, the elect enjoy an assurance of God’s love, peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Spirit, increase of grace, and hope of glory.

Q. 72: Can true believers fall from their state of grace?

A: True believers, because of God’s unchangeable love, His decree and covenant to grant them perseverance, their inseparable union with Christ, His continual intercession for them, and the presence of His Spirit and seed of God abiding in them, can neither totally nor finally fall out of their state of grace, but are preserved by the power of God through faith unto salvation.

Q. 73: Can true believers be infallibly assured that they will remain in a state of grace?

A: True believers who endeavor to walk in good conscience before Him, may, without extraordinary revelation, be infallibly assured that they are and will remain in a state of grace, persevering to salvation. This assurance comes from faith grounded on the truth of God’s promises and from the Spirit, who gives believers spiritual insight into their own hearts, to which these promises are directed. The Spirit also testifies with their spirits that they are the children of God.

Q. 74: Are all true believers at all times assured of their salvation?

A: Since the assurance of grace and salvation is not essential to faith, true believers may have to wait long before they obtain it, and once they have obtained it, their assurance may be weakened and interrupted from being afflicted by all kinds of psychological problems, sins, temptations, and from losing the sense of God’s favor. However, the Holy Spirit keeps believers from complete despair by never allowing them to be without an inner sense of His presence and support.
