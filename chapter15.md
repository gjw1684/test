# The Lord's Supper

Q. 165: What is the Lord’s Supper?

A: The Lord’s Supper is a sacrament of the New Testament in which bread and wine are given and received as Christ directed to proclaim his death. Those who receive the Lord’s Supper in the right way feed on his body and blood and thereby are spiritually nourished and grow in grace. They have their union and communion with Christ confirmed, and they publicly witness to and repeat anew their thankfulness and commitment to God and their mutual love and fellowship with each other, as members of the same mystical body.

Q. 166: What are Christ’s directions for giving and receiving the bread and wine in the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper?

A: Christ has directed ministers of His Word to administer the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. First, they should set apart the bread and wine from their ordinary use by the biblical declaration, thanksgiving, and prayer. Then they take the bread, break it, and give both it and the wine to the communicants, who, according to the same directions, are to eat the bread and drink the wine, thankfully remembering that the body of Christ was broken and given, and His blood shed, for them.

Q. 167: How do those who receive the Lord’s Supper in the right way feed on the body and blood of Christ?

A: The body and blood of Christ are not present in bodily or physical form, either in, with, or under the bread and wine in the Lord’s Supper. They are, however, spiritually present to the faith of the recipient just as truly as the external elements are obvious to the senses. And so those who receive the Lord’s Supper in the right way do truly and actually feed on the body and blood of Christ, not in a bodily or physical way, but spiritually, while by faith they receive and apply to themselves Christ crucified, along with all the benefits of his death.

Q. 168: How do we prepare to receive the Lord’s Supper?

A: Preparation for the Lord’s Supper involves careful examination: of the condition of our life in Christ; of our sins and failings; of whether we truly and to what degree know God, believe in Him, and have repented, and of whether we love God and our fellow believers. We should have a charitable attitude toward everyone, including forgiveness of those who have wronged us. We must also assess how much we desire Christ and whether we are living in newness of obedience. Finally we must renew the practice of these graces in us by serious meditation and fervent prayer.

Q. 169: Should those who have doubts about their position in Christ or about whether they are ready to take communion come to the Lord’s Supper anyway?

A: Those who have doubts about their position in Christ or about their readiness to take communion may nonetheless have a valid interest in Christ, even though they are not yet assured of being in him. In God’s view, if such people are aware of and grieved by their lack of assurance, sincerely want to be found in Christ, and want to get away from sinning, and (since promises are involved in the sacrament, and it has been established to aid even weak and doubting Christians) if people in that condition are truly sorry for their lack of faith and work hard to resolve their doubts, they may and ought to come to the Lord’s supper, so that their faith may be further strengthened.

Q. 170: Should the Lord’s Supper be withheld from anyone who professes the faith and wants to come to it?

A: The sacrament should and must be withheld by the authority Christ has left in his church from those whose profession of faith is based on spiritual ignorance or whose lives have scandalized the church, until they are properly instructed and demonstrate by their behavior that they have reformed their lives.

Q. 171: How must we receive the Lord’s Supper when it is offered?

A: In receiving the Lord’s supper when it is offered, we should reverently and attentively wait on God, as we carefully observe the sacramental elements and their administration. We should take specific notice of the Lord’s body and meditate feelingly on his death and suffering and so stir up in us a lively effect of God’s spiritual gifts. We should critically examine ourselves and repent of our sins. We should earnestly hunger and thirst after Christ, feeding on him by faith, drawing from his fullness, trusting in his merit, rejoicing in his love, and giving thanks for his grace. We thereby renew our covenant with God14and our love for fellow believers.

Q. 172: What should we do after we have received the Lord’s Supper?

A: After receiving the Lord’s Supper, we should think about our participation in the sacrament and whether we got anything out of it. If we have been spiritually renewed and comforted in that participation, we should bless God for it, pray for the effect to continue, watch out for relapses, fulfill our vows, and be encouraged to take communion frequently. If, on the other hand, we have not received any immediate benefit from our participation, we should more carefully go over how we prepared for and participated in the sacrament. If this review reveals no fault in us before God and our own conscience, then we should wait for the spiritual fruit of participation to come to us in due time. However, if such a review finds us at fault in either preparing for or participating in the sacrament, we must humbly resolve to be more careful and diligent in the future.

Q. 173: In what ways do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper coincide?

A: The sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper coincide in that God is the author of both,and the spiritual part of both is Christ and His benefits. Both are signs of the same covenant, are ordinarily to be administered by ministers of the gospel, and are to continue in Christ’s church until the second coming.

Q. 174: In what ways do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper differ?

A: The sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper differ in that baptism is administered just once, with water, as a sign and seal of our regeneration and engrafting into Christ. The Lord’s Supper, on the other hand, is to be administered repeatedly with the elements of bread and wine, to represent and display Christ as spiritual food for the soul and to confirm our continuing growth in Him
