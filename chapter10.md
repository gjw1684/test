Q. 97: What are we especially taught by these wordsbefore mein the first commandment?

A: The words,before me, in the first commandment teach us that God, who sees everything, takes special note of and is very offended by the sin of having any other god.

They also urge us to be just as mindful of the fact that God sees everything we do as we are doing things in His service.

Q. 98: What is the second commandment?

A: The second commandment is:You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.

Q. 99: What is required in the second commandment?

A: The second commandment requires us to receive, respectfully perform, and preserve completely and purely all the regulations for religion and worship that God has established in His word.

Q. 101: What are the reasons annexed to the second commandment?

In addition to calling attention to the fact thatGod totally rules over us so that we belong to Him, these words point to His fervent eagerness tobe worshiped correctly, and that He is angered and takes vengeance on all false worship, whichhe sees as spiritual prostitution. He views breaking this commandment as equivalent to hatingHim and threatens to punish those who do break it for several generations. He also equatesobserving this commandment with loving Him and keeping all His commandments, and promisesmercy for many generations to those who do it.

A: The third commandment is:You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.

Q. 103: What is required in the third commandment?

A: The third commandment requires the holy and reverent use in our thought, meditations, words, and writing, of God’s name; titles; qualities; regulations; word, sacraments and prayer; oaths and vows; casting lots, His works, and anything else by which He makes Himself known. This treatment will be reflected in holy affirmations of our faith and conduct that matches our affirmations, to the glory of God and the good of ourselves and others.

Q. 104: What is forbidden in the third commandment?

A: The third commandment forbids: not using God’s name as is required; the abuse of it through ignorance, empty or unholy treatment; irreverence; superstition, or any wicked reference to his titles, qualities, regulations, or works; blasphemy; perjury; all sinful cursing; oaths and vows; and casting lots; violating our oaths and vows, if lawful, and keeping them, if aimed at unlawful things; complaining and quarreling about or misapplication of God’s decrees and acts of providence.

Q. 105: What is the reason annexed to the third commandment?

A: The reasons are in these words:_for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name._Because He is the LORD and our God, His name must never be treated as unholy or misused by us in any way, particularly since He is so opposed to acquitting or sparing those who break this commandment that He will not allow them to escape His righteous punishment, even though many who do break this commandment escape human condemnation and punishment.

Q. 106: What is the fourth commandment?

A: The fourth commandment is:Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

Q. 107: What is required in the fourth commandment?

A: The fourth commandment requires all men to sanctify or set apart to God the times He has established in His Word, and specifically one whole day out of every seven. This was the seventh day from the creation of the world to the resurrection of Christ, and the first day of the week ever since, which will continue until the end of the world. This is the Christian Sabbath, in the New Testament calledthe Lord’s day.

Q. 108: How is the Sabbath to be sanctified?

A: The Sabbath is to be sanctified by a holy resting for the whole day, even from such worldly employments and recreations as are lawful on other days. Except for necessary works or acts of mercy, we should joyfully spend all our time publicly and privately worshiping God. To that end, we must prepare our hearts and carefully plan ahead so that our worldly business is taken care of beforehand in order that we may more readily spend the day the way God requires.

Q. 109: What is forbidden in the fourth commandment?

A: The fourth commandment forbids failing to do anything required by the commandment; or doing it carelessly, negligently, or in such a way as not to benefit from it, and being tired of keeping it; also treating the day as unholy by loafing, by doing anything in itself sinful, and by all useless works, words, and thoughts about our worldly affairs and recreations.

Q. 110: What are the reasons annexed to the fourth commandment?

A: The reasons added to the fourth commandment to emphasize its importance are first of all implied by its inherent fairness; God allows us six days out of every seven for own affairs and reserves only one for himself, in these words:Six days shall you labor and do all your work. God also insists that this day belongs to him,The seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God._And there is the example of God himself, who in_six days made the heavens and the earth, the sea, andall that is in them, but rested on the seventh day. Finally God put a blessing on that day, not just by making it a holy day for serving him but also by establishing that our keeping the Sabbath holy will be a blessing to us as well,Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

Q. 111: Why does the word Remember begin the fourth commandment?

A: The word _Remember_begins the fourth commandment in one respect, because it is highly beneficial to remember it: the word helps us prepare ourselves to keep the commandment, and when we do, it helps us to do a better job keeping all the other commandments; and the word also reminds us to remain ever thankful for the two great benefits of creation and redemption, which contain the essence of true religion. In another respect, the word “remember” reminds us how easy it is to forget to keep the Sabbath, for several reasons. First, keeping the Sabbath is not obvious to our natural, human understanding, while it additionally restricts our freedom from doing things that are lawful on other days. And, coming only every seventh day leaves plenty of time for us to become so engrossed with our own worldly affairs that we forget to prepare for the Sabbath or keep it holy. Finally, Satan himself with the tools at his disposal is hard at work to blot out the glory and even the memory of the Sabbath and so promote the neglect of religion and irreverence.
