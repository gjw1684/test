# Sin and the Fall

Q. 22: Did our first parents continue in the state wherein they were created?

A. Our first parents, being left to the freedom of their will, through the temptation of Satan, sinned against God in eating the forbidden fruit and thereby, fell from the state wherein they were created.

Q. 23: What is sin?

A: Sin is any lack of conformity unto, or transgression of, any law of God, given as a rule to the reasonable creature.

Q. 24: Did all mankind fall in Adam’s transgression?

A: Since the covenant made with Adam was as a public person (not for himself only but for his posterity), all mankind, descending from him by original procreation, sinned in him and fell with him in that first disobedience. The fall brought mankind into a state of sin and misery.

Q. 25: What is sinful about the fallen condition of mankind?

A: The sinfulness of mankind’s fallen condition consists in the guilt of Adam’s first sin, the lack of original righteousness, and the corruption of his whole nature, whereby he is thoroughly biased, disabled, and antagonistic to all that is spiritually good as well as being continually and completely inclined to all evil, which is commonly called original sin; together with all actual transgressions which proceed from it.

Q. 26: How is original sin conveyed from our first parents unto their posterity?

A: Original sin is conveyed from our first parents unto their posterity by natural procreation, so as all that proceed from them in that way are conceived and born in sin.

Q. 27: What misery did the fall bring on the mankind?

A: All mankind, by their fall, lost communion with God, are under His wrath and curse such that we are by nature children of wrath and slaves of Satan, and made liable to all miseries and punishments in the world and that which is to come.

Q. 28: What are the punishments for sin in this world?

A: The punishments of sin in this world are both internal and external. Internal punishments for sin in this world include blindness of mind, a reprobate sense, strong delusions, hardness of heart, horror of conscience, and vile affections. External punishments for sin in this world include God’s curse on the whole creation for our sakes, and all other evils that befall us in our bodies, our reputations, circumstances, relationships, and employments, including death itself.

Q. 29: What are the punishments for sin in the world to come?

A: The punishments for sin in the world to come include everlasting separation from the comfortable presence of God and the most grievous torments in soul and body in hellfire, without interruption, forever.
