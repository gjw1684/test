# Baptism and the Church

Q. 152: What is baptism?

A: Baptism is a sacrament of positive and sovereign institution of the New Testament, ordained and appointed by Jesus Christ to be continued in His church to the end of the world. For believers, baptism is a sign of our union and fellowship with Christ, of the remission of our sins through His blood, of regeneration by His Spirit, of adoption, resurrection unto everlasting life, and of giving up into God, through Jesus Christ, to live and walk in newness of life.

Q. 153: How should baptism be administered?

A: Those who are appointed to preach the gospel are the ones who are appointed to baptize. The outward element to be used in this sacrament is water, wherein the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Immersion, or dipping of the parson in water, is necessary to the due administration of this sacrament.

Q. 154: How do we continue to use our baptism?

A: We have a necessary but frequently neglected obligation to use our baptism our whole lives, particularly in times of temptation and when we are present at the baptism of others. We should seriously and thankfully reflect on what is involved in baptism, why Christ established it, the privileges and benefits conferred and signified by it, and the significance of our own solemn vows when we were baptized. This reflection humbles us when we recognize how defiled we are by sin and how far short we fall of living up to, and indeed walk so contrary to the standards set by the grace of baptism and by our other spiritual commitments. We are also assured of pardon from sin and of all the other blessings signified in that sacrament. We draw strength from the death and resurrection of Christ, into whom we were baptized, in order to keep killing our sins and becoming alive by His grace. We are also spurred on to live by faith, to have our human relationships defined by holiness and righteousness, as is proper for those who have given up their names to Christ, and to walk with each other in brotherly love, as is proper for those baptized by the same Spirit into one body.

Q. 155: Who should be baptized?

A: Those who do actually profess repentance towards God, faith in, and obedience to, our Lord Jesus Christ, are the only proper subjects of this sacrament. The infants of believing parents are not to be baptized because there is neither command nor example in the Holy Scriptures nor necessary consequence from the Scripture to baptism them.

Q. 156: Were not infants baptized when whole households were baptized?

A: For the cases of household baptisms, it does not appear that there were infants in the homes since the word of the gospel was spoken to the entire household; the whole household rejoiced, believing in God; and elsewhere the whole house is said to do that which infants could not do. Thus, the apostles give no command, example, or inference to baptize the infants of believers.

Q. 157: Did not baptism come to replace of circumcision and thus, should be administered as it was?

A: Baptism does not replace circumcision, but rather regeneration by the Spirit, the circumcision made without hands (commonly called spiritual circumcision), is the proper antitype to circumcision and is the only seal of the covenant of grace. Baptism is mentioned with faith as the means whereby we are in Christ, and complete in Him. Thus, we should not administer baptism according to the rules of administration for circumcision.

Q. 158: If Abraham’s physical descendants were circumcised under the Old Covenant, why shouldn’t the children of believing parents be baptized under the New Covenant?

A: The children of believers are not Abraham’s true offspring by virtue of physical birth, but only by virtue of faith in Christ. We know that the covenant made with Abraham consisted of two parts. In the first part, Abraham’s natural offspring through Isaac constituted the nation of Israel, and through this covenant, God promised the land of Canaan and other temporal national blessings, conditioned on circumcision and their obedience to the Law. In the second part, Abraham’s spiritual offspring constituted the Church, and through this covenant, God promised eternal life and other spiritual blessings, conditioned only by faith in Christ. Therefore, it’s an error to confound the national covenant with the covenant of grace (which the Abrahamic covenant typified), and the commonwealth of Israel founded on the first covenant with the Church founded on the second covenant. This implies that the children of believers are not in the covenant of grace by birth, but only by virtue of faith in Christ, and thus, should not receive the sacraments of the covenant.

Q. 159: What is the duty of those who are rightly baptized?

A: It is the duty of those who are rightly baptized to join themselves to a visible and orderly church of Jesus Christ so that they may walk in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.

Q. 160: What is the visible church?

A: The visible church is the organized gathering of professing believers, in all ages and places, wherein the gospel is truly preached and the sacraments of baptism and Lord’s Supper are rightly administered.

Q. 161: What are the special privileges of the visible church?

A: The visible church has the privilege of being under God’s special care and government and of being protected and preserved throughout the ages, in spite of the opposition of all her enemies. The visible church also provides fellowship for God’s people, functions as the ordinary means by which people are saved, and extends God’s grace through Christ to all her members in the ministry of the gospel, testifying that whosoever believes in him will be saved and excluding no one from fellowship who desires to come to Christ.

Q. 162: Is everyone saved who hears the gospel and attends church?

A: Not everyone who hears the gospel and attends a visible church is saved. The elect are only the true members of the invisible church.

Q. 163: What is the invisible church?

A: The invisible church consists of the whole number of the elect, in all ages and places, gathered into one under Christ, the head.

Q. 164: What are the special privileges of the invisible church?

A: The members of the invisible church have the privilege of enjoying union with Christ, whereby they are spiritually joined to Christ as their head, and thus, partake of the power of His mediation in all things which manifests their union with Christ. The members of the invisible church enjoy the firstfruits of communion in the glory that Christ fully possesses and enjoy the full fruits of their communion in Christ following death, whereby they receive full redemption of their bodies and complete holiness of their souls.
