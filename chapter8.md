# Death, Resurrection, and Judgment

Q. 75: Shall all men die?

A: Since death is the wages of sin, it is appointed unto all men to die once because all have sinned.

Q. 76: Since death is the wages of sin, why are the righteous not delivered from death?

A: The righteous will be delivered from death itself at the last day. Moreover, even when they die, they are delivered from the sting and curse of death, and God’s love completely frees them from sin and misery, enabling them to have a deeper communion with Christ when they enter into His glory after death.

Q. 77: What benefits do believers receive from Christ at death?

A: The benefits that believers receive from Christ at death involve their souls being made completely holy and being received into the highest heavens, which are fruits of their communion in glory with Christ. There they behold the face of God in light and glory as they wait for the full redemption of their bodies, which even in death continue united to Christ and rest in the grave as in a bed, until at the last day body and soul are reunited.

Q. 78: What shall be done to the wicked at death?

A: At death, the souls of the wicked shall be cast into hell, where they remain in torment and utter darkness, and their bodies lie in their graves until the resurrection and judgment of the great day.

Q. 79: What must we believe about the resurrection?

A: We must first of all believe that at the last day there is going to be a general resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. When that happens, those who are still alive on earth shall be instantly changed, and the very same bodies of the dead that were buried will be reunited with their souls and raised up by the power of Christ. Through the Spirit of Christ and by virtue of His resurrection, as their head, the bodies of the righteous will be raised in power, spiritual and imperishable, and made in the likeness of Christ’s glorious body. Christ will raise up in dishonor the bodies of the wicked, who offend Him as judge.

Q. 80: What shall immediately follow after the resurrection?

A: Immediately after the resurrection shall follow the general and final judgment of angels and men, of which no one knows the day or hour so that all may anticipate, pray for, and be ever ready for the coming of the Lord.

Q. 81: What benefits do believers receive from Christ at the Day of Judgment?

A: At the Day of Judgment, believers will be caught up with Christ in the clouds and placed on His right hand, where they will be publicly acknowledged and acquitted. They will join Christ in the judgment of reprobate angels and men, and be received into heaven. There they will be completely and forever freed from all sin and misery, filled with unimaginable joy, and made perfectly holy and happy both in body and soul, in the vast company of each other and the holy angels. They will be particularly blessed in the visual presence and enjoyment of God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, forever.

Q. 82: What shall be done to the wicked at the Day of Judgment?

A: At the Day of Judgment, the wicked will be put on Christ’s left hand, and with the evidence against them clearly presented and fully recognized by them, they will be justly and terribly condemned, after which they will be cast out from the favorable presence of God and the glorious fellowship with Christ, His saints, and His angels, and thrown into hell to be punished forever with unspeakable torments, both of body and soul, along with the devil and his angels.
